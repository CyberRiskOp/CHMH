**Ideals**

  - Hire in a way that builds relationships with candidates, even when the decision is not to hire someone.
  - Choose a person with a growth mindset, a great attitude, and strong aptitude for the work, over a person who is highly skilled but is only in it for the money or often treats others badly.
  - “Fit” is 40% technical skills and 60% culture.
  - Consider how the candidate will represent your team, as well as build and spend political capital.
  - Don’t look for strengths as a primary justification to hire someone; instead look for big reasons why they won’t be a good fit.
  - Either make a great partner out of Human Resources or minimize their involvement.
