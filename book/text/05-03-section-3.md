  1. What if someone on your team just wants to do the same tasks all the time? – depends on the value of their current work set, and your needs. There are many practical reasons for an employee who wants to stick to a particular work set. If these same tasks are a valuable contribution, there is nothing wrong if it is a satisfactory space for the company. We are creatures of habit, and that employee may have other priorities or personal situations to deal with outside of work, where they feel as though they do not have the mental capacity to take on new skills or tasks. Perhaps they have children, dependent parents, or are working through schooling. It may be temporary. If this is not satisfactory, lay out your expectations and give them a chance to respond to the gap between what company expectations are compared to their current performance.
