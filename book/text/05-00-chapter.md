**Ideals**

  - Make leading and managing your people easier by setting a high bar for choosing which candidate to hire.  
  - Create psychological safety among your team members so they feel free to say what’s on their minds.  
  - Insist on an atmosphere of candid, respectful collaboration with each other.  
  - Aggressively create learning and growth opportunities for your people by sending them to training, giving them a learning stipend, and sharing your network with them.  
  - If an employee appears with an offer for a new employer, don’t use it as an opportunity to attempt to retain them. Instead, congratulate them on their new opportunity.
