Conduct the interviews
======================

Before we talk about what questions to ask (and not ask), you need to make your interview questions the same for all candidates. And be sure that each interviewer uses the same questions with each candidate.
 
Why?
 
Because you’re comparing each candidate to the same job description, the opportunity is ripe to inject some useful structure into the evaluation and decrease the chance of a mis-hire. You are also setting some boundaries to reduce the risk that an interviewer will ask illegal or unethical questions (see subsection below).
 
To further reduce this risk, and to better screen candidates, be sure to limit the questions to the skills, knowledge, and abilities that are required to be successful in that job. This should be straightforward to do because you already know what kind of behaviors and skills you want from your ideal hire for this position.
 
An unexpected benefit of this approach is you are helping each interviewer gain a depth of understanding about what this role is really about and what they can expect from the person that you ultimately hire.
 
Another benefit of this approach is candidates will see the interviewers as all being on the same page in terms of what they expect from the person who lands the job. This will reduce confusion all around and better prepare the successful candidate to hit the ground running from day one.

When to involve your current team members
-----------------------------------------

Bringing a new person onto your team is a big deal. You want to pick the right person and you want that person to succeed. While a new person’s ability to succeed is a function of their own abilities, it’s also a function of the daily support they receive from their new team members. Unless you have a strong reason to distrust your team’s perspective, involve them in the interview process and listen to their recommendations.
 
Of course, the hiring manager needs to oversee all the interviews conducted by others. And, they often conduct an interview with the final candidate(s) before deciding who’s going to get the offer.
 
In contrast, you have a wide range of options for involving your team members. At one end of the spectrum, you could involve some or all of them heavily throughout the interview process, which we believe is ideal. Or, their involvement could be nothing more than welcoming their new co-worker after you make the hiring decision without their help, which is usually not a good idea.
 
We find there are two major variables driving team involvement:
 
  1. 	Available time
  2. 	Role they will play

Available Time
--------------

Many hiring managers feel crushed by a never-ending tidal wave of urgent tasks. They struggle to find time for tasks that are important, but not urgent. Having current team members help select their new co-workers is a great example.
 
It may seem better to keep your team members focused on urgent matters to avoid missing commitments to your internal customers.
 
But that might be a big mistake. Bringing a new person onto the team will be disruptive to existing team members if they don’t already know them. Giving the team leaders time to help select new team members can greatly reduce that disruption.
 
Where will the time come from? We believe it’s a matter of prioritization, which you need to do all the time with your budget, so you have the ability to make similar priorities with team time. You might have to renegotiate a deadline to make it happen, but it will pay back many benefits in terms of how fast your new hire will be able to come up to speed with the help of their new team.

Role they will play
-------------------

If you commit to having your team members involved in the interviewing process, it will help a lot if you are clear about what role they will play.
 
Will they each conduct a 1:1 interview with every candidate? Is their role to simply make a recommendation about who to hire, or do they get a formal “vote”?
 
However you want to involve them, and you should make their role clear.

How To Get HR To Conduct Initial Phone Screens Effectively
----------------------------------------------------------

  - Goal for HR involvement: Find and remove candidates early in the hiring process who display a big reason why they are not a good fit for the organization and for your team based on the job as you defined it and based on the criteria you set.  
  - Not a goal for HR involvement: To conduct the one and only interview to determine “fit” for your team.  
  - How to achieve the goal: Build a strong working relationship with your HR rep so they know what you’re really looking for in a candidate.  
  - What if you can’t achieve this goal: Minimize HR involvement, or conduct a second “initial” screening call with everyone that HR screened. If you end up in this situation, despite your best efforts, be sure to not burn your bridges with HR. While our Ideal is to “Hire in a way that builds relationships with candidates, even when the decision is not to hire someone” it will help you in the long run if you build the best relationship you can with your HR rep. Who knows? Things change and if you maintain contact, you may have the opportunity to build the kind of partnership with HR that you really want.  

Handling Candidate Personal Information
---------------------------------------

During the process of reviewing and interviewing job candidates, we are exposed to a lot of personal identifiable information, or PII. Protection of this information is a responsibility of everyone involved in the hiring and employment process.  While there are countless laws that relate to the handling of this information, there is a common thread among them all. That is, maintaining information only for as long as required for the purpose in which it was collected and used. After which, the data should be purged from systems. 

This is especially important considering we may receive hundreds of applications for a single job posting, making us a greater target for malicious actors who may want to exploit job seekers or commit identity theft. 

While we are considering candidates, there may be information shared or provided which we should be cautious in our handling of, through the consideration process:

  - **Contact Information.** The contact information of a candidate should be limited only to those who need to contact the candidate. Otherwise, it should be marked out when the resume or CV information is shared.  
  - **Health Information.** A potential candidate may share information related to a health condition in which accommodations may be required. Should this occur, the information should only be shared with HR for consideration of accommodations and otherwise not documented unless otherwise determined by HR or Legal.  
  - **Identity Verification.** A hiring manager may be responsible for the collection of identification documents that are required to confirm the candidate is legally allowed to work. This information should preferably be provided by hand, but should you need to receive them digitally, it should be only via secure methods. Sending the candidate a URL to securely upload their identity verification directly to your server is generally a good approach. In contrast, email is not a secure method on its own, so if a candidate emails their documents, make an effort to remove it from your email database so it won’t get caught up in backups, archival, or email journaling systems.

As always, it’s best to verify any specific requirements and processes with your Legal and HR teams as they may include reporting or documentation obligations not otherwise discussed in this section. Further, having a documented process for how you are handling this information will also benefit the organization, should one not yet be established.

If you are not familiar with your municipality’s laws and you operate in the United States, the National Conference of State Legislatures has a great succinct breakdown on each State’s laws which can also help you in your understanding of laws specific to your area: https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/data-security-laws.aspx 

What Not to Ask During Interviews
---------------------------------

Hiring employees is a highly regulated activity. There are laws and regulations at all levels of government designed to prevent illegal discrimination “against a job applicant or an employee because of the person’s race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, transgender status, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information” [U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)](https://www.eeoc.gov/overview).

You can expect to see restrictions at the federal, state, county, and city/town levels. The effective Cybersecurity Hiring Manager knows and follows these rules for the jurisdictions where their business is operating.

During the interviews, you need to stay focused on relevant questions. Even if the candidate offers information that you’re not allowed to request, that’s not an open door to ask illegal or unethical follow-up questions.

Questions that are not allowed during the interviews are typically those that have nothing to do with the candidate's ability to do the job. More to the point, these questions are usually related to illegal forms of discrimination. 

When interviewing candidates it's important to focus on questions topically relevant to the position, their ability to perform the job, and what they can contribute to the team. Some questions can end up being illegal, and others are just generally not useful in determining the viability of a candidate. While our curiosity and interest in building connections with people can lead us down the point of asking different questions, we can find ourselves asking information that can open us up to legal action or an EEO claim.

When in doubt, don’t ask. While the below are general guidelines, we are not your legal counsel and we recommend any questions you feel are necessary that could be in the below mentioned areas be evaluated by a legal professional.

Because laws vary from location to location, we can’t give a full and accurate list of all the questions that are prohibited. You can get the list that applies to you from your human resources partner.

So, what questions should we avoid in an interview?

  - **Age related questions.** These can be direct such as asking how old you are, or can be surmised based on when someone graduated from High School. This also applies to questions around retirement, comfort around certain ages of employees, and so on. If the work being conducted requires people to be above 18 or 21 for liability reasons, you can ask if they are over that age, and nothing more.  
  - **Prior salary.** A candidate’s prior salary information is not important to your hiring efforts and questions on this are becoming increasingly against the law. If you want to avoid spending time with candidates whose salary expectations may not align with your budget, post the range in your job posting or mention early on that the job has a pay range, cite the range, and ask them if that is something they can work with.  
  - **Individual traits.** Avoid any questions related to race, gender orientation, gender representation, sexual orientation, traits, visual differences, height, weight, or genetic-related information.  
  - **Family or living situation.** A candidate’s family or living situation, while tempting to ask, is a prime area where our assumptions or biases can get the best of us. Asking questions around spouses, kids, pregnancy or living situation are off limits. Even if a candidate voluntarily provides this information, you should avoid documenting them to avoid influence on your decisions. If the employee is remote, limit questions to things related to the job such as “is there an area of your home you can work without distractions?”.  
  - **Use of public transit.** How an employee gets to our workplace should not matter and can fall into discrimination around financial status. Instead, we should be focused on if they can arrive by a particular time. The rest of the details are for the candidate to address by themselves. If the job posting requires use of a personal car for conducting company business, you can ask if they have one. Though, recognize that said personal vehicle requirement is likely disqualifying other viable candidates if they haven’t had the opportunity to acquire a personal car.  
  - **Arrests and convictions.** Questions about convictions must be limited to those that are related to the job, if the job is sensitive, or requires government security clearance. Questions around arrest are more limited in nature depending on your municipality, especially as an arrest is based on suspicion and not a legal judgement. This resource from Nolo.com can be helpful in additional to advice from legal counsel: [https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-laws-use-arrests-convictions-employment.html](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-laws-use-arrests-convictions-employment.html)  
  - **Nationality or ethnicity.** Any questions, even related to the language or dialect a person speaks, are a means to deduce someone’s national origin or ethnic background and grounds for an EEO complaint. The exception here is if a particular language is necessary to be spoken as part of the job that is not the language you are actively speaking in. Beyond that, you can ask whether they are authorized to work in the country.  
  - **Religious background.** These questions are often related to the availability of a person around the holidays. Avoid references to specific religious holidays and focus on their availability as it pertains to the role.  
  - **Disability and health status.** Disabilities and health issues can be both visible and invisible to us during the hiring process. Even if you never intentionally discriminated against someone with a disability, you can be set up for an accusation that you did if it's something you asked. Your focus should instead be on whether the candidate can perform the job. Should they need accommodations, the candidate should bring that up after you’ve made the offer. While there are some exceptions to whether you can ask about accommodations, that is a question best left to your HR partner or legal counsel.  
  - **Military Service.** While asking about a candidate’s military service is generally allowed, avoid questions relating to the type of military service and reason for discharge unless it is explicitly required for security clearance. Instead, ask what training or experience they received that relates to the position.  
  - **Prior Job Experiences.** Asking a candidate about their prior job experiences primes the candidate to be negative. Clearly, there is a reason why they are looking for a new job, but all you need to focus on is whether they are a fit for your job opening. Instead, focus on questions as to what brought them to apply.  
  - **Unemployment or Gaps in Employment.** It’s OK to ask about gaps at a high level. However, asking for details about gaps of employment or unemployment should generally be of no concern in determining if a candidate is a good fit as there are any number of reasons for it. Such questions could wade toward discrimination claims if it related to family related matters, health related, and so forth.  
  - **Finances.** Asking candidates for information details about their personal finances is not appropriate and has no bearing on them conducting their job. However, it is reasonable to ask whether the candidate can live without excess stress on the compensation you offer.  

There are also many kinds of unethical questions that you should avoid. In part because they aren’t relevant to the candidate’s ability to do the job. And because they can lead the interviewer into asking illegal follow-up questions. For example, stay out of these areas:

  1. Whether they drink alcohol and how much
  1. Any topics related to dating
  1. Questions that are designed to indirectly uncover information you are not allowed to ask for directly, such as their year of graduation from high school or college

Here are some example questions that you do not want to ask candidates:

  1. Where were you born?
  1. Are you going to want to take time off for religious holidays?
  1. Do you plan on getting pregnant/having children?
  1. When did you graduate from high school?
  1. Do you have a disability?
  1. Have you ever filed a workers’ compensation claim?
  1. How did you learn Spanish?
  1. Are you a U.S. citizen?
  1. How much longer do you plan on working?
  1. Where’s your accent from?
  1. Do you have children?
  1. Do you need Sunday mornings off for church?
  1. What’s your background?
  1. Have you been really sick in the last year?

As you can tell, some of the above questions could be asked without your intent to discriminate illegally. But candidates can’t be expected to figure that out by themselves. To be on solid ground, we suggest writing up your questions in advance and then asking your human resources partner to review your list before you start interviews.

Overall, your focus in evaluating a candidate should be on their ability to perform the job based on the description you provided, whether they satisfy the requirements you have set forth in the job posting, and if they’ll be a good fit. You can worry about getting to know them more after an offer has been extended and accepted.

  2. Human (soft) skills: critical thinking, ability to influence & persuade, empathy and emotional intelligence, ability to quickly learn (and apply) new skills, tools, and concepts, humility, being approachable, reliability, resourcefulness, curiosity
  3. Willing to teach others and document to enable teaching future employees
  
Effective Interviewing Techniques
---------------------------------

*Stefanie Hoffman: It's important to remember that not all candidates, even ones that are very skilled, interview the same way. Techniques like asynchronous interviewing, outlining the interview "itinerary" or what the candidate can expect ahead of time and interviews in which the candidate can demonstrate their skills should all be considered. Also, employers should demonstrate that they are willing to make accommodations for neurodivergent or disabled candidates.*

  1. Ineffective interviewing techniques (avoid these traps)
  2. Technical interviews and take-home projects best practices
  3. Panel interview best practices

Effective Types of Interviews
-----------------------------

  1. Cultural fit (2-way street)
	*Stefanie Hoffman: Interviewer should have some understanding of the candidate's cultural background and how that will likely affect or influence their responses.*
  2. Hard skills (this should be defined and/or scoped to fundamental skills for that role, we can also emphasize that all technical skills can be learned)

Interview Questions
-------------------

  1. Behavioral
  2. Technical
  3. Cognitive
  4. Personality
  5. Workstyle
  6. Human (Soft) Skills
  7. Aptitude

Interview Answers
-----------------

  1. Using a scoring system
  2. Red flags
     1.	Misused security or technology terms
     1. Outright lying or gross exaggeration
     1. Manipulative responses
     1. Unable to articulate how they personally contributed to the success of a project (flag: using “we” instead of “I” a lot)
     *Stefanie Hoffman: Is this a red flag? Some candidates, and often women, will naturally give credit to "the team" having been conditioned not to "brag" or openly market themselves, even if they personally contributed a lot. There are way to ascertain a candidate's personal contribution without just paying attention to the pronouns they use.*
  3. Green flags
     1. Good understanding of the nature of risk
     1. Thinking and consideration beyond technology problems
     1. Self-driven to research or learn
     1. Active contributor to the community
  4. How to spot potential on-the-job integrity problems
  5. How to spot exaggerated skills or experience
  6. Panel interviews
     1. Who should be involved
     1. What questions each panel member will ask
     1. How to ensure candidate feel safe to answer panel questions
