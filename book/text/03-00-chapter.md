**Ideals**

  - Put similar skills into the same job description so people don’t have to be rule makers and rule breakers, nor be the incident responder and the compliance person in the same week.  
  - Attract people who could work anywhere, but choose to work for us because of the way we do things.  
  - Widen your talent pool by growing your own talent and finding talented people that you’ve previously overlooked.  
  - Define “diversity” among your team as using the differences people have in their life experiences to bring unique perspectives to creatively solving problems.
