**Foundation**

  - Take enjoyment from building teams and helping people excel in their careers while achieving your program goals.
  - Treat hiring as one of the most important duties you perform in support of your organization.
  - Before you reflexively hire to replace someone, ask “is there a better way to get this work done?”
  - Better to delay hiring than to mis-hire, because no one wins when that happens.
