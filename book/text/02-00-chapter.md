**Ideals**

  - Take enjoyment from building teams and helping people excel in their careers while achieving your program goals.
  - Treat hiring as one of the most important duties you perform in support of your organization.
  - Before you reflexively hire to replace someone, ask “is there a better way to get this work done?”
  - Better to delay hiring than to mis-hire, because no one wins when that happens. 

**Why We’re Losing the War on Cybercrime**

We’ve all seen the statistics by now. According to the US Department of Commerce, there are over half a million unfilled cybersecurity jobs in the US. Around the world, those numbers are even greater, with an estimated 3.5 million jobs unfilled. There’s a huge cost to these unfilled positions. According to a 2020 US Internet Crime Report, cybercrime is estimated to cost businesses and private citizens $4.2 billion. And that’s just the reported crimes! 

A lack of investment from senior decision makers is the main contributor to this problem. There are simply not enough people in information security. Companies are not investing in training the next generation of security professionals. When companies DO invest in security, they hire people with years of experience doing the same work. These companies are trying to solve their security needs by taking talent from everyone else! This just isn’t sustainable in the long run.

Most senior decision makers STILL do not understand the importance of cybersecurity. They don’t invest in it at their companies. Some simply do not understand the risk of cybercrime to their organization. Others think things like “breaches happen to other companies, not us”, “who would want to attack us?” or “we don’t have any data that anyone would want to steal”.

So what ends up happening? Well, these executives hire one or two people to do security for their entire company. Think about this for a moment. How many of your peers work on a small team of one, two, or three people for a company that has one, two, or three hundred people? We know some people in that situation, and we're willing to bet that you do as well. In fact, we know of many companies, even some Fortune 500 companies that only have a handful of people doing security as their full time job. 

If we’re serious about winning the war on cybercrime - not just as business leaders - but as individuals that genuinely care about protecting our friends, family, and community - the way we recruit and hire the current and next generation of cybersecurity professionals must change. We must stop: 

  - Treating hiring and caring for our team as an interruption to our "true work".
  - Making mistakes that attract the wrong candidates to apply to our jobs.
  - Requiring years of experience and CISSPs on entry-level job descriptions. 
  - Listing 2 to 3 pages of responsibilities for a single person. 

The current way of hiring in security is a losing strategy. We need a new approach and a new mindset - to build great teams and build the next generation. And we need to do this NOW, not next week, not next year, and not in five years. The folks that we select and train TODAY will be the experienced defenders that we need tomorrow.

**The Role and Roles of the Modern Cybersecurity Team**

Cybersecurity has grown and evolved from being a purely technical trade to being one that works alongside the business to help achieve shared goals. The responsibilities of cybersecurity now span all business functions and verticals, because security risk exists across all business functions and verticals, not just within IT or Engineering.

Cybersecurity exists to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our business systems and data. However, that’s not all. A great cybersecurity team also helps its organization innovate and operate in a secure environment. We’re here to enable the business, and tell them how they securely achieve their goals.

Good security helps the bottom line, while reducing the cost and burden of unnecessary risk. 

To be successful as security professionals, we must be great at two things: understanding security and understanding the business. And as a security leader, you must mold both your security program and your team to align with your company’s needs and objectives.

So how do we build a successful team in today’s world? 

What is the recipe for a winning modern cybersecurity team?

Think about some of the greatest sports teams from around the world. They always have two elements - a great coach, and team members that work really well together. If you look closely, every great sports team really only has one or two star players on their rosters, the rest are role players. But when great teams come together, they win. 

Like great coaches, great business leaders take time to self reflect. They think about ways of improving themselves in order to help their team and those around them.

  - First, let's reflect on your leadership style.
  - Do you empower your people to achieve their goals? 
  - Do you inspire and motivate? 
  - Do you coach, mentor, and teach? 
  - Do you demonstrate a growth mindset?

Now let's reflect on your team. 

  - Do you have a roster full of star players that aren’t able to get along?
  - Or do you have a team that is able to work really well together and win, regardless of each individual’s “star” status? 
  - Does your team consistently achieve its goals? 
  - And does your team win?

In order to build a winning security team, you’ll need these two elements - a great leader - hopefully you - and team members of all different roles and abilities that can come together to accomplish the goal of protecting and managing risk for the business.
