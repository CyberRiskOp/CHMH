Letting go of poor performers
=============================

**Rough outline for this section--please contribute**

  1. We promote successful employees until they aren’t successful anymore, consider moving them to a role where they have been successful rather than removing them? (could using a career path approach decrease the risk of poor performance?)  
  1. When your hire doesn’t work out  
  1. Performance improvement plan  
     1. Reiterate to the employee that you want to retain them and their contribution is valuable  
  1. Progressive discipline process
     1. Work with HR
