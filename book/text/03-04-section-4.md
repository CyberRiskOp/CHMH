Write a compelling job description
==================================

Job Descriptions for Intermediate and Advanced People
-----------------------------------------------------

 1. Research other current job descriptions. Don’t reinvent the wheel. (but don’t just copy/paste from other JDs)
 1. Cybersecurity job description “must haves”
 1. Manage to outcomes as much as possible (Key Result Areas, KRA)
 1. Check with HR to see if there are any organization-specific requirements
 1. Reconsider the need for college degrees/security certifications
 1. Include work culture information passively or actively
 1. Unbiased job description


Job Descriptions for Entry Level People
---------------------------------------

The way most entry-level job descriptions are written is contributing to the talent shortage in our industry. There are just too many requirements listed for qualification into these entry-level roles. 

Creating a great entry-level job description can be straight-forward and easy. But first, I want to tell you about four things that you should NOT put on your entry-level job descriptions.

First, don’t ask for any number of years of work experience. A true entry-level candidate won’t have any work experience in the industry. Remember, the saying, “Cybersecurity requires years of experience.” is a myth. 

There are plenty of entry-level tasks that don’t require years of experience. Besides, someone with years of experience won’t want to do a job that they’re overqualified for anyway. Instead, ask for zero years of experience. Then mentor and train the people that you hire.

Second, don’t ask your candidates to have knowledge in specific technologies and tools. Those things can be taught, and more importantly, learned. Instead, look for characteristics and qualities that are harder to teach. Qualities like motivation, curiosity, and critical thinking. Soft skills, like emotional intelligence, empathy, initiative, and resiliency - qualities in a person that are more difficult to teach than technologies or tools.

Third, stop asking for degrees in engineering, computer science, or information systems. Technology changes so quickly, that even if a candidate has a college degree in a technical field, it doesn’t mean that they know the latest and greatest techniques and tools. Instead, look for people who are constantly learning, because constant learning is critical for success in our profession.

Finally, stop requiring advanced security certifications like the CISSP for entry-level roles. The CISSP requires 5 years of full-time professional cybersecurity experience before you’re even eligible for the cert, so requiring it just doesn’t make any sense. 

Think about some entry-level job descriptions you’ve seen recently. Did they include any of these four things? If they did, now you understand what the next generation is up against. There are simply too many unnecessary gates keeping out the very same folks that we need by our side as defenders.

What Great Candidates Look For
------------------------------

If you’re still struggling to find great candidates for your team, consider what the most great candidates look for in a company and in a job description.

Great candidates want to understand the role, the company, and their expectations.

  - To Understand the role - they want to know things like - What would their direct responsibilities be? And What would their day-to-day look like? 
  - To Understand the company - they’ll research your industry,  growth opportunities within your company, and company health.
  - To Understand their expectations - What is the success criteria for this role? And What is expected from them the first 30, 60, 90 days on the job? 

Remember, great candidates need to see themselves working for you and your company. Great candidates will always do their own research about the companies they apply to.They will proactively reach out to talk to people at your company. They’ll want to know what you’re like as a manager, and what their future teammates are like. 

Once you understand what great candidates are looking for, writing a job description that will attract great candidates is easy. 

  - Make sure you define the expectations and what success looks like. Outline what is expected from them in their first 30, 60, and 90 days on the job. Clearly define what the objective criteria for success is. 
  - You also need to define the role and responsibilities. Clearly define direct responsibilities, outcomes, and goals of the role. It might be tempting to list 20 or 30 responsibilities, but don’t do that. Limit the responsibilities list to 5-7 instead. This will help you clearly define what this person will be doing for you. 
  - Define the personality traits (aka “soft skills”) of a successful team member. Clearly describe what type of person you’re looking for in terms of “people skills”, like adaptability, ability to learn quickly and thoroughly, resiliency, and empathy. Use your company’s core values to help guide your hiring decisions. Don’t compromise on soft skills! 

Finally, remember that interviewing is a 2-way street. Great candidates want to be sold ON the job, just as much as they want to sell themselves FOR the job. So stay positive, curious, and humble when speaking with candidates. Treat them as your equal, because they are. 

Reflection: Review Your Most Recent Job Description
---------------------------------------------------

Now that you know what a good job description looks like, let’s review yours. Let’s see if they are written in a way that will attract great candidates. For this exercise, start with any open position on your team, regardless of seniority level, or your own.

Here's a rubric. Compare each section within your job description with the scoring table. Give each a grade from 0 to 4, 4 being the best. Again, be objective with the scoring.

Once you’re done rating all of the sections, tally up and average the scores. 

  - If your average is 3 or higher, your job description is solid. Ask a peer to grade you as well, and see if their scores agree with yours.
  - If your average is between 2 and 3, you’ve got room to improve. Work on getting your lowest scoring section or sections above your average score. 
  - Finally, if your average is lower than 2, here’s an opportunity. Consult with your HR team or a trusted mentor to improve. Use this grading rubric as a guide to reword your sections.

Poorly written JDs can impact your ability to attract and retain talent. You want to review the JDs of your team regularly, and across seniority levels. 

Remember, you want to hire the best! So don’t let a bad job description be the reason why you don’t attract great candidates.
