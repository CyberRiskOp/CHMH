Write a compelling job description
==================================

**Rough outline for this section--please contribute**

  1. Write a compelling job description
	 1. Research other current job descriptions. Don’t reinvent the wheel. (but don’t just copy/paste from other JDs)
	 1. Cybersecurity job description “must haves”
	 1. Manage to outcomes as much as possible (Key Result Areas, KRA)
	 1. Check with HR to see if there are any organization-specific requirements
	 1. Reconsider the need for college degrees/security certifications
	 1. Include work culture information passively or actively
	 1. Unbiased job description
