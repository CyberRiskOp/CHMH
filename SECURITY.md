# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

A repo related to Cybersecurity should have a security.md. We acknowledge that, and hopefully soon this will be the norm everywhere.
So far this new project, which is cloned from an open source repo, is being supported by non-devs or individual security testing. 
With security testing and updates being the critical cyber defense, we acknowledge we need and appreciate your help with this project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, open an issue or a pull request here on the repo.

We will do our best to test and merge security updates within 90 days, after 90 days we support you publishing your findings. 

We encourage and thank you for your support to this project.
